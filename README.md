## 👋 Hey, I’m Logan — Programmer, Problem-Solver, Pizza Enthusiast

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m currently a developer at **OSI Maritime Systems**, where I’m building real-time object detection systems using **YOLO** to make maritime navigation smarter and safer. I'm also the founder of **Clutch AI**, a project under Enactus BCIT that's changing the way teams manage Agile schedules using Slack, Trello, and ChatGPT.

Oh — and when I’m not doing that? I’m training an AI to dominate in the game of **Abalone**, just for the sheer joy of it.
